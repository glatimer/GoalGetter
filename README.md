# RunMate

## Setup for developers

There are instructions for setting up the repo on your local machine in Wiki >> Setup

## Description

For this application we wanted to build an all-in-one running tool that would help the user plan a new running route, calculate the miles, and complete the run with a celebration.

## Use Case

The goal is to allow a runner to focus on the real work of running and not be distracted with organization and to provide positive feedback with a celebration for completing a run.

## Features

- Running route planner
- Celebrate a completed run!
